# rocket-race
This is a beginner game in html to simulate multiple rockets taking off into space. However, sometimes there are unforeseen problems that cause the rocket to crash back down to earth before reaching its destination. The user will click on the rocket as it climbs through the atmosphere and watch the rocket fall back to Earth, simulating a "Houston! We have a problem" scenario. Clicking the rockets will cause them to fall back to the Earth, but the counter will keep track of the score.
